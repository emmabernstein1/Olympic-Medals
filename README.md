# Summer Olympic Medals

## Goal
Our objective for this project was to scrape data from the olympics.org website, classify the data and ultimately create a dashboard to display our findings. We used our knowledge in python, pandas and the BeautifulSoup library to extract data. Then we used our knowledge of orm python and SQLAlchemy to transform our data into populated tables. We loaded our dashboard using Flask and attached the Dash app to create data visualizations. Our main focus was on gathering information on all medals over the last 10 olympic games. With this, we were able to compare medal counts across countries, as well as the succession of scores for game events.

## Requirements

	- Flask (for the website) 
	- SQL Alchemy (for ORM) 
	- Dash (for graphing)
	- Plotly (for graphing)
	- Beautiful Soup (for scraping)
	- Requests (for making requests to http)
